# DefangBot for Slack

**DefangBot** is a Slack bot that helps keep your chats safer. It's all about making sure those links shared around are not going to cause any trouble. Whether you've got a link that looks a bit iffy and you want to stop it from being a direct click-through, or you've got a defanged link you're now ready to trust, this bot's got you covered.

Think of it as your digital bouncer for URLs in Slack.

It's perfect for teams who deal with a lot of links and want an extra layer of precaution without leaving their Slack workspace. Plus, it's super easy to use; just add it to your Slack, and it starts working its magic on any links shared.

**Happy (and safe) linking!**
